# Searching a Scraped Database with Python
This is a project utilizing Flask and SQLite to allow us to search a database using Python. This uses a sqlite DB containing 100 restaurant records scraped from Yelp. Flask allows us to run a local server to search the database with specific criteria. 

### Prerequisites
The only requirement needed to run this project file is:
```
A python interpreter (I used Spyder IDE)
```

## How to Run
1. Create a new directory.
2. Place the ```yelp_server.py``` file, as well as the ```static``` and ```template``` folders within the new directory.
3. Open the ```yelp_server.py``` file in your python interpreter and run/execute the code.
4. You can access the web page at http://localhost:5000/.
5. Select the criteria and search the database. 

## Built With
* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) - The python interpreter used
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Microframework used for local server
* [SQLite 3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) - The library used for the database
